## Release Info
**Author**: Paul Leonard
**Version**: 0.9.0

## Overview
This module defines a few different mathematical series including the Fibonacci Series and Lucas Numbers.  A third function allows you to manipulate the value of the first two numbers in the sequence.  Discover your very own series!

## Architecture
Through the use of basic Python functions, this script defines a few different mathematical series including the Fibonacci Series and Lucas Numbers.  The functions are located in a module and a seperate test module was used during the Test Driven Development (TDD) of the function definitions.
